# Learning_game
A game made on unity game engine which uses C#. The game displays questions and answers are launched towards the player and the user must choose the right answer by jumping. Questions and answers are added to the code and are stored in an array. All visual assests are made by me in a software called Aseprite which is used for making pixel art.
