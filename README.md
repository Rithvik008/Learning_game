# Learning_game
A learning based game made on unity game engine which uses C#. The game has a pixel art style theme. Questions are displayed and then answers are launched towards the player and the user must choose the right answer by jumping. Questions and answers are added to the code and are stored in an array. All visual assests are made by me in a software called Aseprite which is used for making pixel art. The game as originally designed for ADHD children and has been designed to attract the user's attention constantly throughout the game. The player character standsout fro the background so that there is no chance of distraction and seamless game playing.
